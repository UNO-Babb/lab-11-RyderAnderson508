I changed the number of items a shopper can check out from 1-100 items becuase someone could wlak in there and one thing 
while another could get an entire shopping cart full of stuff. and i check the number of checker to 6 people as i felt it 
optomized idle time to check out time for the number of items. 
    And it added an addition of the average items per shopping by using the same concept as the wait time by useing the e in the 
event line.
